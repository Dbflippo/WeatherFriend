# WeatherFriend
Weatherfriend seeks to revolutionize the world of weather by providing users with a friendly experience catered to their busy lifestyles

Weather information gathered utilizing Weather Underground API

Here are some goals for Weather Friend, in order of importance:

1) I want the application to select my current location by default in order to avoid always having to enter my current location.
2) I want quick recommendations for how to prepare for the day so that I don’t always have to read a bunch of detailed weather information.
3) I want to be able to see basic temperature and sky information for my area so I can get a quick impression of the day’s weather.
4) I want to see what it “feels like” outside so I can quickly decide how to dress without having to read temperature/wind/cloud coverage, etc.
5) I want to be able to see a three-day weather forecast for my area so I can prepare for future days’ weather.
6) I want to be able to select the location for which I see the weather info.
7) I want an emergency alert function for emergency weather conditions so I know when I need to evacuate from an area.
8) I want to be able to see a radar map for weather in my area for more detailed information.
